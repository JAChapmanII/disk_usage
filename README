disk_usage contains several implementations of colored disk usage displays

disk_usage is the original bash script which uses output from `df` to get disk
usage information. Originally it was written with an exorbitant amount of
processes spawned per mount; it has since been rewritten to do as much as
reasonably possible inside bash itself.

diskUsage.cpp is a small experiment to see how fast we can do compared to the
(now) relatively efficient pure-bash implementation.

subproc_method also spawns df and processes its output just like the
disk_usage bash script contained in this repo.

syscall_method uses the C API for parsing the /proc/self/mounts information.

By default diskUsage.cpp uses hardcoded escape sequences for color codes, so
that the syscall_method will spawn no other processes.
